# DnD-Py
 Set of digitals tools to aid you in your Dungeons and Dragons adventures.
All of them developed purely with python.
### Dice Roller
The first app of this project allows you to input the number and modifiers of you die so you dont have to roll the same dice over and over again in those moments of need.
